# ðŸš— Electric Vehicle Climate Control & Safety Check System
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Climate Control System and Safety Check System for an electric vehicle using Arduino. It simulates real-time vehicle features such as temperature regulation, safety validation (seat belt and door lock checks)

#Features:
This project simulates core features of an electric vehicle including:

-Climate Control System: Allows passengers to set desired temperature using a keypad. Based on input, the heater or cooling fan is activated. Real-time temperature, fan speed, and heater status are shown on an LCD.

-Safety Check System: Prevents the vehicle from moving unless all seat belts are fastened and doors are locked. Feedback is provided through the LCD.

Additional Functions:

Vehicle movement based on accelerator/brake pedal input.

Automatic headlights based on ambient light via LDR.

Real-time status updates on LCD.
